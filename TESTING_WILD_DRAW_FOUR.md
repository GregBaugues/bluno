# Testing Wild Draw 4 Turn Skipping Fix

This document outlines the steps to test the fix for GitHub issue #18: "Bug: Wild Draw 4 card doesn't skip player's turn".

## Test Plan

1. Navigate to the Bluey UNO game (http://haihai.ngrok.io)
2. Start a 2-player game (player vs. Bluey)
3. Play cards until Bluey plays a Wild Draw 4 card against you
   - You may need to reload the game several times until this happens
   - Alternatively, to speed up testing, you can manually trigger the UI state by modifying the game state in the browser console
4. Observe the message "Draw 4 cards! Your turn will be skipped."
5. Draw all 4 cards by clicking the deck 4 times
6. Verify that after drawing all 4 cards, your turn is skipped and it becomes Bluey's turn again
7. Confirm that Bluey (AI) automatically makes a move

## What Was Fixed

The bug was in the `handleRequiredDraw` function in `game.js`. The function was not properly advancing the turn after the player finished drawing cards from a Wild Draw 4. The fix includes:

1. Adding proper calculation of the player who should go next after skipping
2. Fixing the turn advancement logic with a double `nextTurn()` call
3. Updating the UI message to correctly show whose turn it will be

## Expected Results

- After drawing the 4th card, the message "Cards drawn! Your turn is skipped. Bluey's turn now." appears
- The turn indicator highlights Bluey as the current player
- Bluey automatically makes a move after a short delay
- The player cannot play any cards during this process

## Test Verification

If all of the above conditions are met, the fix has been successfully implemented.
