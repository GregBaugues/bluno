# Critical Bug Report: Unable to Play Valid Cards

## Issue Description
During automated testing of the Bluey UNO game, we discovered a critical bug where valid cards cannot be played, even when they match the color of the top card on the discard pile.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start a new game with 3 players
2. When it's the player's turn, observe that the top card on the discard pile is a Green 1
3. Attempt to play a Green 9 card from the player's hand
4. Observe that the card is not played despite being clicked
5. The same issue occurs with other valid cards

## Expected Behavior
When clicking a valid card (matching either color or number of the top card), the card should be played and moved to the discard pile.

## Actual Behavior
Clicking on valid cards does nothing. The card remains in the player's hand and the game state does not change.

## Technical Details
The issue was verified through Puppeteer automated testing. Multiple selectors were tried:
- `.playable-card`
- `.card.green`
- `#player-hand .card.green:first-child`

None of these allowed a valid card to be played.

## Impact
This is a game-breaking bug that makes the game completely unplayable. The player cannot take their turn, preventing normal gameplay.

## Suggested Investigation Areas
1. Check the card click event handlers in `ui.js`
2. Verify the card validation logic in `game.js`
3. Check for JavaScript errors in the console when attempting to play a card
4. Ensure the CSS class `.playable-card` is being correctly applied to valid cards

## Priority
High - This should be fixed immediately as it completely prevents gameplay.
