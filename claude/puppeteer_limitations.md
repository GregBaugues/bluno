# Puppeteer Testing Limitations with Bluey Uno

Based on our testing, we've identified several challenges when using Puppeteer to test the Bluey Uno game:

## Working Features
- Navigation to the game URL works as expected
- Taking screenshots works properly
- Basic clicking on elements like buttons works (we were able to start the game)

## Limitations and Challenges

### 1. JavaScript Evaluation
- `puppeteer_evaluate` calls consistently fail with the error: "Error calling tool puppeteer_evaluate: undefined"
- This prevents us from running custom JavaScript to inspect element properties, check game state, or simulate complex interactions

### 2. Element Selection Challenges
- Selector-based clicking works for simple elements (`button`, `.player-cards .card:first-child`)
- However, the clicks don't always trigger the expected game behavior (cards don't get played)
- This might be due to:
  - The game using custom event handlers that Puppeteer's click simulation doesn't trigger properly
  - Cards not being playable according to the game rules, but no visual feedback is captured in screenshots
  - Dynamic class assignment (like `.playable-card`) that we can't verify without working JavaScript evaluation

### 3. Game State Observation
- It's difficult to determine if actions were successful
- We can't programmatically check if:
  - A card was successfully played
  - A card was drawn
  - It's the player's turn or the AI's turn
  - An action was invalid according to game rules

### 4. Timing Issues
- The game has animations and delays for AI moves
- Without JavaScript evaluation, we can't effectively implement waiting for specific game state changes

## Recommendations for Testing

1. **Use Direct Selectors**: When testing, use the most specific and direct selectors possible:
   - `#deck` for the deck
   - `.player-cards .card:nth-child(1)` for specific cards in the player's hand
   - `button` for buttons in the welcome screen

2. **Use Visual Verification**: Take screenshots after each action to visually verify the results

3. **Game Initialization**: Starting a new game by clicking the player count button works reliably

4. **Simple Interactions**: Focus testing on simple interactions like:
   - Starting the game
   - Clicking on cards
   - Clicking on the deck

5. **Limitations to Be Aware Of**:
   - Drawing cards and playing cards may not work as expected
   - Special card actions (like Wild cards) may not trigger color selection UI
   - AI turns may not progress properly
   - Game state cannot be programmatically inspected
