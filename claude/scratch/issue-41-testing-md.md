# Issue 41: Draft TESTING.md

## Issue Link
https://github.com/GregBaugues/bluey-uno/issues/41

## Problem Statement
Create a comprehensive TESTING.md document that provides detailed instructions on how to test the Bluey-Uno game, specifically focused on using Puppeteer for testing. The document should include:
- What works and what doesn't work
- Specific selectors to click on
- How to use Puppeteer to test this game specifically
- Format that is best for Claude to understand and execute

## Implementation Plan
1. Test the game thoroughly using Puppeteer to understand its behavior
2. Document all UI elements with their selectors
3. Create step-by-step instructions for common game actions
4. Document known limitations and issues with Puppeteer testing
5. Draft the TESTING.md document with clear, structured instructions
6. Test the instructions to ensure they work as expected

## Tasks
- [ ] Explore the game interface using Puppeteer
- [ ] Create a comprehensive list of key game elements and their selectors
- [ ] Test and document the game initialization process
- [ ] Test and document player actions (selecting cards, playing cards)
- [ ] Test and document AI opponent behavior
- [ ] Test and document special card actions
- [ ] Identify and document any limitations or issues with Puppeteer testing
- [ ] Create step-by-step examples for common testing scenarios
- [ ] Draft the TESTING.md document
- [ ] Verify the instructions work by testing them
