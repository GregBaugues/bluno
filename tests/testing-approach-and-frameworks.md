# Testing Approach and Framework Recommendations for Bluey Uno

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended testing approach and frameworks for the Bluey Uno card game, supporting the refactoring efforts outlined in issue #6. A comprehensive test suite will provide a safety net for making structural changes to the codebase.

## Testing Frameworks

### Recommended Primary Framework: Jest
Jest is our recommended testing framework for the Bluey Uno project for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity** - Zero configuration setup for most JavaScript projects
2. **All-in-one solution** - Includes test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities
3. **Snapshot testing** - Perfect for testing UI components and DOM structures
4. **Built-in code coverage** - Easy to track test coverage metrics
5. **Mocking system** - Powerful capabilities for mocking modules, functions, and timers
6. **Parallel test execution** - Tests run in parallel for faster feedback
7. **Watch mode** - Automatically runs tests when files change
8. **Good documentation** - Extensive documentation and large community support

### Alternative: Mocha + Chai
If more flexibility is needed, consider Mocha with Chai:

1. **Flexible assertion styles** - Chai offers multiple assertion styles
2. **Plugin ecosystem** - Many plugins available for specific testing needs
3. **Framework agnostic** - Works with any JavaScript framework
4. **Custom reporters** - More customization options for test output

### DOM Testing: JSDOM
For testing DOM interactions without a browser:

1. **JavaScript implementation of the DOM** - Simulates browser environment in Node.js
2. **Fast execution** - Much faster than browser-based testing
3. **Compatible with Jest** - Already included with Jest
4. **Scriptable** - Can simulate user interactions

### End-to-End Testing: Puppeteer
For full browser-based testing:

1. **Chrome automation** - Controls Chrome browser for realistic tests
2. **Screenshot capabilities** - Can capture visual state for verification
3. **Full page testing** - Tests complete user interactions
4. **Performance analysis** - Can measure rendering performance
5. **Network interception** - Can mock backend APIs

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
Focus on testing individual functions and components in isolation:

- Test pure functions with various inputs
- Mock dependencies for isolated testing
- Target small, specific behaviors
- High coverage goals (80%+)

### 2. Integration Testing
Test how modules work together:

- Test interactions between related components
- Verify data flow between systems
- Use fewer mocks, more real implementations
- Focus on module boundaries

### 3. End-to-End Testing
Test complete user flows:

- Simulate real user interactions
- Test full game scenarios
- Focus on critical paths (game start to finish)
- Browser-based testing for UI verification

### 4. Visual Regression Testing
Ensure UI appearance is maintained:

- Snapshot test key UI components
- Compare renders across refactoring changes
- Test responsive layouts
- Verify character and card appearances

## Test Organization

### File Structure
Organize tests to mirror the application structure:

```
/tests
  /unit
    /deck
    /game
    /players
    /ui
    /sounds
  /integration
    /game-flow
    /card-effects
  /e2e
    /gameplay
    /win-scenarios
  /fixtures
    /game-states
    /cards
    /players
  /helpers
    test-utils.js
```

### Naming Conventions
Follow consistent naming patterns:

- Unit tests: `[component-name].test.js`
- Integration tests: `[feature-name].spec.js`
- E2E tests: `[scenario].e2e.js`
- Test fixtures: `[name].fixture.js`

### Test Documentation
Each test file should include:

- Brief description of what's being tested
- Any special setup requirements
- Test coverage goals
- Related components/files

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setting Up Jest
1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest @testing-library/dom 
```

2. Configure in package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
  },
  "jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
    "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/tests/setup.js"],
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "\\.(css|less)$": "<rootDir>/tests/mocks/styleMock.js",
      "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg)$": "<rootDir>/tests/mocks/fileMock.js"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Create necessary setup and mock files.

### Writing Effective Tests

#### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern
Structure tests using the AAA pattern:
```javascript
test('should draw a card when requested', () => {
  // Arrange
  const gameState = createGameState();
  const initialHandSize = gameState.players[0].hand.length;
  
  // Act
  drawCard(gameState, 0);
  
  // Assert
  expect(gameState.players[0].hand.length).toBe(initialHandSize + 1);
});
```

#### 2. Use Descriptive Test Names
Name tests clearly to document behavior:
```javascript
// Good
test('should skip next player when skip card is played', () => {});

// Better
test('when skip card is played, the next player in sequence should lose their turn', () => {});
```

#### 3. Test Fixtures
Create reusable test data:
```javascript
// fixtures/game-states.js
export const newGameState = {
  players: [
    { name: 'Julia', hand: [], isAI: false },
    { name: 'Bluey', hand: [], isAI: true },
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
};

export const midGameState = {
  // state representing mid-game
};
```

#### 4. Test Helpers
Create functions for common testing operations:
```javascript
// helpers/test-utils.js
export function createGameWithCards(playerCards, discardTop) {
  const gameState = createGameState();
  gameState.players[0].hand = playerCards;
  gameState.discardPile = [discardTop];
  return gameState;
}
```

## Test Coverage Goals

Aim for the following coverage targets:

- Core game logic: 90%+ coverage
- Deck management: 90%+ coverage
- UI rendering: 80%+ coverage
- Special card effects: 85%+ coverage
- Sound system: 75%+ coverage

## Continuous Integration

Configure tests to run on CI/CD:

1. Run tests on every pull request
2. Block merges if tests fail
3. Generate and track coverage reports
4. Run full test suite before deployment

## Testing Challenges and Solutions

### Asynchronous Operations
- Use Jest's async/await support
- Test with fake timers for animations
- Wait for DOM updates with testing-library utilities

### DOM Interactions
- Use @testing-library/dom for querying elements
- Simulate events for interaction testing
- Test both event handlers and resulting DOM changes

### Random Behaviors
- Mock Math.random for deterministic tests
- Use seeded random generators for repeatable tests
- Test boundaries and edge cases explicitly

### Sound Testing
- Mock Audio objects
- Verify sound function calls rather than actual playback
- Test sound loading error handling

## Next Steps

1. Set up the basic testing infrastructure with Jest
2. Create initial test fixtures and helpers
3. Start with unit tests for core functionality
4. Gradually build up integration and E2E tests
5. Configure CI integration

## Conclusion

This testing approach provides a solid foundation for maintaining and improving Bluey Uno, supporting the refactoring work and ensuring the game continues to function correctly as changes are made.
