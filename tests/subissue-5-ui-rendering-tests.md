# Subissue 5: UI Rendering Tests

## Overview
This subissue focuses on implementing tests for the UI rendering system of Bluey Uno, ensuring that the game UI accurately reflects the game state, cards are properly displayed, and animations work correctly.

## Test Cases

### Card Rendering Tests
- Test that cards render with the correct colors and values
- Verify card size and positioning within player hands
- Test card rendering in the discard pile
- Verify that card back is shown for AI player cards
- Test card highlighting for playable cards
- Test card rendering after state changes
- Verify card animations during play
- Test card rendering in different screen sizes and orientations

### Player Display Tests
- Test rendering of human player UI elements
- Test AI player character displays
- Verify player names are displayed correctly
- Test current player highlighting/indication
- Verify player hand sizes are displayed accurately
- Test UNO indicator when a player has one card
- Test player positioning in different game configurations (2, 3, or 4 players)
- Verify player display updates after game state changes

### Game State UI Tests
- Test rendering of the draw pile
- Test rendering of the discard pile top card
- Verify current color indicator is displayed correctly
- Test direction indicator (if present)
- Verify turn indicator updates properly
- Test game message displays (player turn, card effects, etc.)
- Verify win/lose state display
- Test game restart UI

### Animation Tests
- Test card movement animations (dealing, playing, drawing)
- Verify character animations/responses
- Test UI transitions between game states
- Verify animation timing and synchronization
- Test animation cancellation or interruption
- Verify animation performance

### Responsive UI Tests
- Test UI layout in different screen sizes
- Verify mobile/tablet adaptation
- Test orientation changes (portrait/landscape)
- Verify touch target sizes for cards
- Test UI scaling for different devices

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Set Up Testing Environment
1. Configure Jest with JSDOM for DOM testing
2. Set up Puppeteer for end-to-end UI testing
3. Create screen size presets for responsive testing

### Step 2: Implement Card Rendering Tests
1. Create tests for card element rendering
2. Implement tests for card state visualization
3. Test card animations and transitions

### Step 3: Implement Player Display Tests
1. Create tests for player UI components
2. Test player state visualization
3. Implement tests for player interactions

### Step 4: Implement Game State UI Tests
1. Create tests for game information displays
2. Test UI updates based on game state changes
3. Implement tests for messaging and indicators

### Step 5: Implement Animation and Responsive Tests
1. Create tests for key animations
2. Test responsive layouts
3. Implement tests for different devices and orientations

## Acceptance Criteria
- All UI components render correctly
- UI properly reflects game state changes
- Animations work as expected
- UI is responsive to different screen sizes
- Tests verify both appearance and behavior of UI elements

## Dependencies
- UI rendering code in ui.js
- DOM manipulation functions
- Game state management
- Animation system
- CSS styling

## Estimated Effort
- Medium to High (3-5 days)

## Implementation Notes
- Use snapshot testing for UI component appearance
- Use JSDOM for isolated component testing
- Use Puppeteer for end-to-end UI tests
- Test both static and dynamic UI aspects
- Create helper functions for common UI assertions
- Test accessibility features if implemented
