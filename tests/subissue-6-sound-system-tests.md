# Subissue 6: Sound System Tests

## Overview
This subissue focuses on implementing tests for the sound system of Bluey Uno, ensuring that game sounds load correctly, play at appropriate times, and can be controlled as needed.

## Test Cases

### Sound Loading Tests
- Test that audio files are loaded correctly
- Verify handling of missing audio files
- Test preloading of character sounds
- Test loading of synthesized sounds
- Verify error handling during sound loading
- Test audio format compatibility detection
- Test loading progress indicators (if implemented)

### Sound Playback Tests
- Test playing character sounds (Bluey, Bingo, etc.)
- Verify game action sounds (card play, draw, UNO call, etc.)
- Test win/lose sound effects
- Verify sound timing relative to game actions
- Test overlapping sound handling
- Verify sound playback completes properly
- Test volume levels and normalization

### Sound Event Tests
- Test sounds triggered by specific game events (turn start, card play, etc.)
- Verify character-specific sound events
- Test sounds triggered by player actions
- Verify special card sound effects
- Test sound effects for win/lose conditions
- Verify ambient/background sounds (if implemented)
- Test transition sounds between game states

### Sound Control Tests
- Test muting/unmuting functionality
- Verify volume adjustment (if implemented)
- Test sound preferences persistence (if implemented)
- Verify sound system initialization/shutdown
- Test sound system pause/resume (for game interruptions)
- Verify handling of browser audio limitations
- Test mobile device sound handling

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Set Up Sound Testing Environment
1. Configure Jest for audio testing
2. Set up mocks for Web Audio API and HTML5 Audio elements
3. Create audio test fixtures

### Step 2: Implement Sound Loading Tests
1. Create tests for audio resource loading
2. Test error handling and fallbacks
3. Implement tests for audio initialization

### Step 3: Implement Sound Playback Tests
1. Create tests for core sound playback functions
2. Test audio element manipulation
3. Implement tests for sound synthesis (if used)

### Step 4: Implement Sound Event Tests
1. Create tests for game event sound triggers
2. Test sound mapping to game actions
3. Implement tests for character-specific sounds

### Step 5: Implement Sound Control Tests
1. Create tests for audio control functions
2. Test user preferences for sound
3. Implement tests for browser-specific audio handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- All sound functionality is thoroughly tested
- Tests verify sounds play at appropriate times
- Error handling and fallbacks are tested
- Sound controls work as expected
- Tests handle browser audio limitations

## Dependencies
- Sound system code in sounds.js
- Audio assets
- Game event system
- Browser audio APIs

## Estimated Effort
- Medium (2-3 days)

## Implementation Notes
- Mock actual audio playback for unit tests
- Use spies to verify sound functions are called
- Consider browser compatibility in test design
- Test both Web Audio API and HTML5 Audio fallbacks
- Test mobile-specific audio behaviors where applicable
- Ensure tests don't produce actual sound during execution
- Consider using a virtual time system for timing-dependent tests
