# Wild Draw 4 Card Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Wild Draw 4 card functionality in the Bluey Uno game.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Excessive Screen Indicators**
   - Eliminated the large, intrusive indicator that covered much of the screen
   - Kept only the small indicator on the deck itself for better gameplay experience

2. **Fixed Game Flow**
   - Game now properly pauses until all required cards are drawn
   - Prevented players from taking actions during the drawing phase
   - Ensured both human and AI players honor the drawing pause

3. **Fixed Color Selection Logic**
   - Ensured color selection appears for the player who played the Wild Draw 4 card, not the next player
   - AI players now select a color before the next player draws cards
   - Human players get the color selection dialog immediately after playing the card

4. **Improved Turn Skipping After Draw 4**
   - Fixed the turn skipping logic to properly skip the player who drew cards
   - Ensured play resumes with the correct player after Wild Draw 4 effects

## Testing Steps

1. Start a 2-player game (player vs Bluey)
2. Play until you or Bluey plays a Wild Draw 4 card
3. Verify:
   - The player who played the card gets to choose the color
   - Game pauses until all 4 cards are drawn
   - After drawing all cards, the player's turn is skipped
   - Play continues with the correct player

These improvements create a more accurate implementation of the Uno rules and a better gameplay experience.
