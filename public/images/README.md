# Bluey Character Images

Place Bluey character images in this directory for them to appear in the game.

## Image Requirements

- **File format**: PNG or JPG
- **Filenames**: Should be lowercase versions of character names (e.g., `bluey.png`, `bingo.png`, etc.)
- **Aspect ratio**: Square images work best (e.g., 400x400 pixels)
- **Content**: Character face/head shots work best since they'll be displayed in circular frames

## Supported Characters

Add images for any of these Bluey characters:
- bluey.png
- bingo.png
- bandit.png
- chilli.png
- muffin.png
- socks.png
- lucky.png
- rusty.png
- coco.png
- snickers.png
- mackenzie.png
- honey.png
- chloe.png
- judo.png
- jack.png

## How It Works

The game will automatically detect and use images when they're available. If an image isn't found for a character, the game will display a colored circle with the character's initial.

## Troubleshooting

If images aren't showing up after adding them:
1. Verify the filenames are lowercase and match the character names exactly
2. Make sure you've reloaded the page after adding the images
3. Check for any console errors in your browser's developer tools
4. Clear your browser cache and reload the page

No code changes are needed - the images will be automatically detected and used when available!
