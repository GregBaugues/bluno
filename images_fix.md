# Character Images Fix Plan

## Diagnosis Steps

1. **Verify Image Loading Process**
   - Add detailed console logs inside the `loadCharacterImages` function to track:
     - When the image loading starts
     - When each image's onload or onerror handler fires
     - The actual src URLs being assigned to image elements
     - Final state of the characterImages object

2. **Check Image Path Resolution**
   - Inspect the built files in the dist directory to confirm correct paths
   - Verify images are properly included in the build
   - Check network tab in browser dev tools to see if images are being requested
   - Test with absolute URLs instead of imports to rule out path resolution issues

3. **Examine Timing Issues**
   - Add timestamps to logs to verify loading sequence
   - Modify the implementation to use a clear loading state flag
   - Ensure `loadCharacterImages` promise resolution is properly awaited

4. **Inspect Integration Points**
   - Check how the `createCharacterDisplay` function interacts with `characterImages`
   - Verify if `characterImages` reference is being shared correctly between modules
   - Ensure loaded images are in the correct format for DOM insertion

## Potential Fixes

1. **Fix Path Resolution**
   ```javascript
   // Instead of imports, try direct URL references
   const characterImageSources = {
     'Bluey': '/images/bluey.png',
     'Bingo': '/images/bingo.png',
     'Bandit': '/images/bandit.png',
     'Julia': '/images/julia.png'
   };
   ```

2. **Implement Eager Loading**
   - Move image loading to happen at application startup
   - Add a loading screen or state until all images are ready
   - Force a UI refresh after images are loaded

3. **Refactor Image Storage**
   - Store actual Image elements (not just src URLs) in the characterImages object
   - Use a global state pattern to ensure consistent access
   - Consider using data URLs for smaller images to avoid loading issues

4. **Improve Rendering Coordination**
   - Modify renderGame to properly await image loading
   - Add a specific update function that runs after images are loaded
   - Consider a reactive approach to re-render components when images become available

5. **Fix Julia Display Conflict**
   - Refactor the inline script in index.html to use the same image handling
   - Ensure Julia is handled consistently with other characters
   - Consider moving all character rendering to the JavaScript modules

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with the most likely issue: image path resolution
   - Test with absolute URLs first
   - Implement a simple test page that just loads the images

2. If path resolution is not the issue, examine timing:
   - Add detailed logging
   - Adjust the loading flow to ensure images are fully loaded before rendering

3. Address any integration issues:
   - Update references to ensure modules properly share state
   - Verify proper DOM construction

4. Consider more structural changes if needed:
   - Implement a reactive rendering approach
   - Refactor the image handling system to be more robust

5. Ensure consistent handling for Julia:
   - Apply the same loading and rendering logic to all characters

## Testing

After implementing fixes:
1. Test in multiple browsers
2. Test with network throttling to ensure graceful loading
3. Test with image blocking to verify fallbacks work
4. Validate that all characters (including Julia) use consistent rendering
5. Verify the UI doesn't break during the loading process

## Notes

- Prefer simpler solutions before complex ones
- Focus on making the code more robust to failures
- Consider implementing a more modern state management approach if this becomes a recurring issue
- Document any changes thoroughly for future maintenance
