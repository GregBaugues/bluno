## Project Architecture

The game is built with a modular architecture to maintain separation of concerns:

### Core Modules

1. **Deck System** (`deck.js`)
   - Creates and manages the Uno card deck
   - Handles shuffling, dealing, and card operations

2. **Game Logic** (`game.js`)
   - Manages the core game state and flow
   - Processes card plays and special card effects
   - Contains main game loop

3. **Player System** (`players.js`, `playerManager.js`)
   - Manages player creation and state
   - Handles AI decision-making for computer players
   - Manages turn progression

4. **UI System** (`ui.js`)
   - Renders the game interface based on game state
   - Handles user interactions and animations
   - Updates display in response to game events

5. **Sound System** (`sounds.js`)
   - Uses Web Audio API for game sounds
   - Provides sound effects for different game events
   - Includes character voice sounds

6. **Character System** (`images.js`)
   - Manages character images and displays
   - Provides fallback with colored initials when images unavailable

### Utility Modules

- **Constants** (`constants.js`) - Game-wide constants and configurations
- **Game Rules** (`gameRules.js`) - Rules enforcement and validation
- **Game State** (`gameState.js`) - State management utilities
- **Turn Manager** (`turnManager.js`) - Manages player turns and direction
- **Events** (`events.js`) - Custom event handling
- **Utils** (`utils.js`) - General utility functions

## Repository Structure

- `/src/` - Source code files
- `/public/` - Public assets
  - `/public/images/` - Character and UI images
  - `/public/audio/` - Sound files
- `/screenshots/` - Game screenshots for documentation
- `/claude/` - Documentation files
  - `/claude/scratch/` - Development notes and planning documents
- `CLAUDE.md` - Technical documentation

## Development

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and content
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations
- **JavaScript** - Game logic and interactivity
- **Parcel** - Bundling and development server

### Testing

The project uses Puppeteer for automated testing. Testing documentation and examples can be found in `/claude/TESTING.md`. Key testing approaches include:

- Screenshot-based testing for visual verification
- DOM interaction testing via click events
- Game state verification

### Adding Character Images

To add custom character images:

1. Place image files in the `/public/images/` directory
2. Update the references in `/src/constants.js`
3. Add preloading elements in `index.html` if needed
