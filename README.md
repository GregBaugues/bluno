## Project Architecture

The game is built with a modular architecture to maintain separation of concerns:

### Core Modules

1. **Deck System** (`deck.js`)
   - Creates and manages the Uno card deck
   - Handles shuffling, dealing, and card operations

2. **Game Logic** (`game.js`)
   - Manages the core game state and flow
   - Handles turn management and game flow
   - Processes card plays and special card effects
   - Contains AI logic for computer players

3. **Player System** (`players.js`, `playerManager.js`)
   - Manages player creation and state
   - Handles AI decision-making for computer players
   - Manages turn progression

4. **UI System** (`ui.js`)
   - Renders the game interface based on game state
   - Handles user interactions and animations
   - Updates display in response to game events
   - Manages animations and visual feedback

5. **Sound System** (`sounds.js`)
   - Uses Web Audio API for game sounds
   - Provides sound effects for different game events
   - Includes character voice sounds

6. **Character System** (`images.js`)
   - Manages character images and displays
   - Provides fallback with colored initials when images unavailable

### Utility Modules

- **Constants** (`constants.js`) - Game-wide constants and configurations
- **Game Rules** (`gameRules.js`) - Rules enforcement and validation
- **Game State** (`gameState.js`) - State management utilities
- **Turn Manager** (`turnManager.js`) - Manages player turns and direction
- **Events** (`events.js`) - Custom event handling
- **Utils** (`utils.js`) - General utility functions

## Repository Structure

- `/src/` - Source code files
- `/public/` - Public assets
  - `/public/images/` - Character and UI images
  - `/public/audio/` - Sound files
- `/screenshots/` - Game screenshots for documentation
- `/claude/` - Documentation files
  - `/claude/scratch/` - Development notes and planning documents
- `CLAUDE.md` - Technical documentation

## Development

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and content
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations
- **JavaScript** - Game logic and interactivity
- **Parcel** - Bundling and development server

### Code Quality

The project uses ESLint for code quality and consistency:

```bash
# Run linting (if configured)
npx eslint src/
```

**ESLint Configuration:**
- Unused imports detection
- Import/export validation
- Modern JavaScript standards enforcement

### Testing

The project uses Puppeteer for automated testing. Comprehensive testing documentation and examples can be found in `/claude/TESTING.md`. 

#### Available Test Commands

```bash
# Run specific wild draw four test
npm run test:wild-draw-four
```

#### Testing Approach

Key testing methodologies include:

- Screenshot-based testing for visual verification
- DOM interaction testing via click events
- Game state verification through automated gameplay
- Selector-based element targeting for UI interactions
- Visual comparison between different game states
- Automated testing of special card mechanics (Wild Draw 4, etc.)

### Recent Visual Enhancements

The latest version includes several visual and UX improvements:

1. **Card Animation and Feedback:**
   - Playful animations when cards are played
   - Visual effects for the discard pile
   - Celebratory effects for special cards

   - More prominent turn indicators
   - Improved visual cues for the current player

3. **Card Design Enhancement:**
   - Larger, more colorful cards with rounded corners
   - Gradient colors and improved emoji visuals
   - Better hover and active states

4. **Welcome Screen Improvement:**
   - Enhanced visual design with animations
   - Improved button interactions

5. **Game Feedback Messages:**
   - Better visual indicators for playable cards
   - Enhanced UNO indicator with animations
   - Clearer feedback for game actions

### Adding Character Images

To add custom character images:

1. Place image files in the `/public/images/` directory
2. Update the references in `/src/constants.js`
3. Add preloading elements in `index.html` if needed
