# Issue 41: Draft TESTING.md for Puppeteer Testing

## Link to Issue
[Issue #41: Draft TESTING.md](https://github.com/GregBaugues/bluey-uno/issues/41)

## Problem Description
Claude sometimes has difficulty testing the Bluey Uno app using Puppeteer. We need to create a comprehensive TESTING.md file that provides clear instructions on how to test the game using Puppeteer, including what works, what doesn't work, and specific selectors to use.

## Plan

1. **Understand the game structure and UI**: 
   - Review the game's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand the DOM structure
   - Identify key elements that need to be interacted with

2. **Create a basic testing template**:
   - Develop a simple Puppeteer script template that can navigate to the game
   - Include commands for screenshots and basic interactions

3. **Test common user interactions**:
   - Test starting a new game
   - Test playing cards
   - Test drawing cards
   - Test special card functionality

4. **Document reliable selectors**:
   - Document all reliable CSS selectors for key game elements
   - Identify any elements that may be challenging to select

5. **Develop workarounds for problematic areas**:
   - For elements that are difficult to interact with, document alternative approaches
   - Create helper functions where needed

6. **Create the TESTING.md file**:
   - Document everything in a clear, well-structured format
   - Include examples and troubleshooting tips

7. **Test the documentation**:
   - Create a sample test script following the documentation to verify its accuracy

## Tasks

1. Create a testing template based on existing scripts
2. Test and document game initialization
3. Test and document player interactions (selecting cards, drawing cards)
4. Test and document special card functionality
5. Create helper functions for common testing patterns
6. Write the TESTING.md file
7. Validate the documentation with a sample test

## Implementation Plan

Let's start by creating a comprehensive TESTING.md file that covers all aspects of testing the Bluey Uno game with Puppeteer. The file will be structured in a way that makes it easy for Claude to understand and use Puppeteer effectively to test the game.
