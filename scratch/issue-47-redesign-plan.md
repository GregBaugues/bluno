[Issue #47: Redesign](https://github.com/GregBaugues/bluey-uno/issues/47)

## Overview
This issue asks for five simple improvements to enhance the look and feel of the Bluey Uno game and improve the gameplay experience for kids.

## Current State Analysis
After examining the game code and taking screenshots, here are my observations:

1. **Visual Design:**
   - The game has a simple, kid-friendly design with pink background and Comic Sans font
   - Character images are circular with fallbacks
   - Card designs use emojis and basic colors with some special effects for different card types
   - The UI is responsive but could benefit from more visual appeal

2. **User Experience:**
   - Current turn is indicated by a small highlight and name display
   - Cards are slightly small and could be easier to interact with
   - The game lacks animations and transitions between actions
   - Card playing feedback could be improved for children
   - Welcome screen is simple but not particularly engaging

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Text is generally readable but could be improved for young children
   - Interactive elements like cards and buttons don't have strong visual affordances
   - Colors are vibrant but there's opportunity to make the game more visually engaging

## Improvement Ideas
Based on the analysis, here are five simple improvements that could enhance the game:

1. **Card Animation and Feedback:**
   - Add more playful animations when cards are played
   - Implement a "swoosh" effect when cards move to the discard pile
   - Add celebratory effects when special cards are played
   
2. **Enhanced Player Turn Indication:**
   - Make the current player indication more prominent and child-friendly
   - Add a bouncing arrow or animated character to show whose turn it is
   - Implement a voice prompt saying "Your turn!" when it's the player's turn

3. **Card Design Enhancement:**
   - Make the cards larger and more colorful
   - Add more playful visual elements to the cards
   - Improve the readability of card values
   
4. **Welcome Screen Improvement:**
   - Add animated characters to the welcome screen
   - Make player selection more engaging with character images
   - Add sound effects to the welcome screen

5. **Game Feedback Messages:**
   - Add positive reinforcement messages when good moves are made
   - Make error messages more friendly and educational
   - Add visual cues for valid/invalid moves

## Implementation Plan
For each improvement, I will:
1. Make targeted changes to the relevant files
2. Test the changes using Puppeteer to ensure the game still works
3. Commit the changes with descriptive commit messages
4. Move on to the next improvement
